               My name is Juliette Amador and welcome to my page! I was born on May 6, 1994 in Miami, Florida. I am the third daughter of Juan and Ivette Amador, in total we are four girls. My parents CLEARLY wanted a boy. I attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School, where I participated in Webdesign, cheerleading and track & field. I graduated from Florida State University in Spring 2016, with a degree in hospitality and marketing. My hobbies include yoga, group exercise classes and hanging with friends and family. I love exercises because it is a great stress reliever.

                Growing up, my mother was a computer analyst. Thus, I've always been into computers and technology. I decided to enroll in University of Miami's Coding Bootcamp because I am interested in changing my career path. Ideally, I would like to stick to business but focus on coding within businesses. I am hoping this course will help make my dreams a reality!

                Overall, I enjoy coding, business, technology and exercise. I feel by completing this course, I will be able to land my dream job. The internet is constantly changing, so this field is always growing.
